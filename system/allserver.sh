# 20-November-2013: Removed stuff from the menu that really next to
# no one needs to see. The menu just does its job now, nothing more or less.
#
# 17-November-2013: I've finally felt like spending the time to improve
# (imho) the colours of the menu & I've also refined it some.
#
# 10-July-2013: Now using pkgCacheClean instead of CacheClean. It uses
# pacman's version checking method.
#
# 11-June-2013: Made Option 1. available (it is useful on the odd occasion).
# Made the display more informative during the progress of each option.
#
# 13-May-2013: Removed the ability for Option 1. to be run standalone, 
# due to having been told to read this:
# https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman#Partial_upgrades_are_unsupported 
#
# 27-April-2013: Updated to use the new pacman-mirrors -g to rankmirrors. :)
#
# allservers.sh - inspired by Manjaro's Carl & Phil, initially hung together 
# by handy, the script's display prettied up & progress information added by Phil, 
# the menu & wiki page added by handy.
# Latest revision now calls everything via the menu.
# The following wiki page is about this script: 
# http://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php/Allservers.sh_Script:-_Rankmirrors,_Synchronise_Pacman_Database
# Following wiki page will introduce pkgCacheClean & related information:
# http://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php/Maintaining_/var/cache/pacman/pkg_for_System_Safety
#___________________________________________________________
# 
# allservers.sh is now completely menu driven. The Menu describes
# what it does for you, if you need more detail see the two
# wiki page links listed above.
